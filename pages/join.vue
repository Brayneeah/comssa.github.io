    <h2>Joining ComSSA</h2>
    To get the most out of ComSSA, you’ll want to become an official member.
    You’ll receive a membership sticker to place on your Curtin ID card, which will entitle you to a range of discounts with our sponsors,
    access to our services, as well as special member pricing for our events.

    You can become a member of ComSSA for $5 if you’re a Curtin Guild Member or for free with a Curtin Student Guild club membership voucher.

    Interested in joining? Here’s how!

    <h2 id="subheading">
      In-Person
    </h2>
    Talk to a committee member around building 314 at Curtin and we’ll be happy to sign you up.
    If you’re not sure who we are, have a look at the posters on the noticeboards.
    This method is required if you are using a club membership voucher.

    Can’t find a committee member? Email the committee to set up a time!

    <h2 id="subheading">
      Online
    </h2>
    If you’d prefer to sign up online, that’s even easier! Unfortunately, you can’t use club membership vouchers to sign up online.

    To get started, head over <a href="https://comssamemberships.getqpay.com/">here</a>.
    You’ll be asked for your Curtin Student Guild membership status, so please use this to let us know if you are a Guild member.
    Please do not mark yourself as paying with a voucher — this will not lessen any online membership fees.
