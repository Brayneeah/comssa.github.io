        <h1>Who are we?</h1>

        <p>
        ComSSA is the club that supports computing, computer engineering, and networking students at Curtin University. <br><br/>
        
        Most of the time, committee members can be found within the 314 level 2 labs.<br><br/>

        We provide a wide range of events and services for our members, such as academic assistance, social events, industry presentations, and free Microsoft software licences!<br><br/>

        Membership is open to everyone, even if youâ€™re not a student! <br><br/>
        
        Being affiliated with the Curtin Student Guild also means that membership is free, if you have a voucher from the Guild diary.
