  * Didn't rain, what a shame

  * Should set the ticket sales cutoff to two weeks before the event
  * Pre-printed tickets should be considered so people don't have to wait out the front
  * Member lists should be printed beforehand

  * Kye: Greg put in heaps of work to get us this room for us, and asked for the room bookings for an "engineering outreach event"

### WEEMAS

  * We have lost Thursday, and Friday until 830pm due to classes being run (therefore changing date wont affect this, the thing about classes is that they run somewhat weekly)
  * We still have the weekend+Monday
  * We need to check with Amanda if we have Tuesday

## PMH

  * Delan: Naz has not gotten back to me yet, will drop in on Tuesday
  * Networking is still a mess: can only use common ports that other lab machines use
  * The VM's are on the back-burner as they have limited usefulness with this networking setup

  * Delan will be changing passwords
