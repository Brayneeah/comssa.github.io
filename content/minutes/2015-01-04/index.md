## Policy framework

  * keydist has been expanded to include a policy system
  * Kye will show Josh and Adam how to use it

## Spending policy

  * We have a first draft, somewhat based on the 2004 version
  * A discussed subset of the policy is below
  * For simplicity and ease of emergency expenditure:
    * Like bank withdrawals, only any two of three signatories are required to spend
    * Approval of the treasurer will no longer be formally required for a transaction
    * However the treasurer should still be kept informed of all purchases
  * Budget of events should be decided by a majority vote
  * No event should exceed $1000 without a unanimous vote
  * Safe must float between $50 and $150
    * Unwritten rule of thumb to keep a significant volume of pool tokens

## Upcoming events

## Advertising

## Purchases

### Card printer

  * Outreach is unlikely to have a card printer which we can access
  * A decent card printer will cost upwards of $1500 new

### Managed switches

  * PLE no longer sells the D-Link, only more expensive managed switches
  * MSY sells Netgear GS724T switches for $219 each
    * Supports SNMP, LACP, 802.1x, QoS, etc.
    * Five year warranty
  * We are only buying 3 switches instead of 5 to minimise costs
  * The remaining tables will be serviced with unmanaged switches

### Pool table maintenance

  * Chalk holders are a thing now, and they are really cheap
  * Luke and Delan will buy more tips and Triangle chalk

## Financial investment
