## IRC rules

  * Delan submitted a rule set
  * With some amendments, the following is a draft:

1. Use common sense: banter is welcome, but avoid being a dick.
2. Avoid posting personal and/or personally identifiable information of
   users unless doing so is in accordance with their wishes.
3. Refrain from spamming or flooding channels or other users.
4. Don't post illegal content or conduct illegal activity over IRC.
5. Don't initiate denial of service attacks against users or servers.
6. Don't acquire the nicks of other users with the intent of maliciously
   deceiving, kicking or banning other users on the network.
7. Committee members reserve the right to kick and/or ban users if and
   only if they are suppressing discussion and/or breaking these rules.
8. Users who have been banned have the right to appeal by sending email
   to comssa@lists.curtin.edu.au.
9. ComSSA is a member of the UniIRC network. Be conscious of the fact
   that your conduct may be seen as representative of the club.

## CoderDojo

  * Welcome Brad as the new champion for CoderDojo
  * We opened the ninja signup form last night and had to close it after
    only one night
  * We have 57 ninjas
  * Four rooms, try to talk to Engineering to get another two rooms
  * Free Scitech on a Monday at some point
  * Mentor training tomorrow: free food
  * Volunteering will be recorded on your transcript
  * Kye made a beautiful site for mentors: http://kanri.comssa.org.au/
  * ComSSA branded pins for high achieving ninjas
    * If Engineering Outreach pays, Curtin branding guidelines are required
    * $325 per term gives us about 50 pins
    * Once off payment for $210 yields 30 pins for black belts

## Amanda

  * Amanda told us that she might not be here afterwards
  * She might be moved to her former role
  * Who do we go through for room booking now?
  * Callum will ask Nicoleta for further details
  * What will happen to Amanda's old office?

## Card printer

  * The card printer is seriously broken
  * Prefer cards over stickers for a sense of membership
  * Decent card printers are very expensive: four digits
  * Wait until after the AGM for the next committee's decision
    * Check the end of year budget

## Mailing list

  * The mailing list has gone down a couple of times for long periods
  * Keep using lists.curtin.edu.au now unless another major outage occurs
  * Investigate how to configure a mailing list in case it's later needed
  * ling would probably be insufficient alone to handle mail
  * If we do more than web and IRC, more servers may be needed in the future

## LAN food

  * Soothers vs. lollies?
  * No meals, and no crumbly or messy food
  * Resealable drinks only, no bubble tea
  * We're going to try to give you nice things at LANs

## Projectors

  * We were supposed to have two projectors for the LAN
  * We only ended up having one projector
  * Trial CITS projector for secondary next LAN
  * Daniel has the trolley, come early on the Friday of the next LAN

## Open floor

  * Cleaning: CEC has the kitchen this month
  * Guild meeting: SSAF funding proposals
      1. Lots of storage space inside Guild
      2. Greatly increased printing budget

## Next meeting: Wednesday 2014-08-06

## Finish: <time datetime="2014-07-16T11:36Z">7:36 p.m.</time>
