## ECU GigaLAN

  * Jasmine and Kieran spoke to eskilla
  * No more details other than the price being $5 or $10
  * Will occur around early/mid July
  * Will advertise the event

## CoderDojo

  * Mentor meeting occurred on Wednesday
    * An attendee at the meeting raised concerns that Jasmine and Kye were
      acting as individuals in CoderDojo rather than representing ComSSA
      * The original state of involvement was intended to be all committee
      * The role is difficult to effectively split among more than two people
      * ComSSA's involvement is probably at its ideal level now
  * Engineering Outreach may delegate choice of next champions to Computing

## Open floor

### ComSSA's page on cs.curtin.edu.au

  * This page sorely needs to be updated or rewritten
  * At a minimum the web and email addresses must be fixed
  * Delan will contact Mary Mulligan to inquire

### Single courses yielding two or more degrees

  * Courses 132210 and 132010 yield Computer Science plus another degree
  * Constitution requires executives to study a degree with > 50% Computing
  * Units belonging to a degree are hard to isolate in a double degree
  * As a whole the above courses do not have > 50% credit in Computing
  * Are these students able to be office bearers?
  * Perhaps change constitution:
    * From "at least one degree with > 50% credit in Computing units"
    * To the above plus e.g. "and/or studying towards a Computing degree"
    * What exactly is a Computing major or degree?
    * Clarify this before and at the AGM

### New projector

  * The Dell is dead, and the Mitsubishi is on its way out
  * We will need a replacement before quiz night
  * Budget is about $800
  * Use for full events only
  * Minimum connectors VGA, HDMI, CVBS
  * Consider alternative sources such as auctions

### Full time student requirement

  * Clarify executive requirement in the constitution at the AGM

### Study mentoring

  * Suggest a program to help students with first year units and exams
  * To be held during semester breaks or near the ends of semesters
  * Retention rates for Computing courses and OOPD is very low
  * Speak to Mike about this idea

## Next meeting: Thursday 2014-06-12

## Finish: <time datetime="2014-05-29T12:01Z">8:01 p.m.</time>
